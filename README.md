Personalization with deep learning in 100 lines of code

### Datasets
The 1bn word corpus file for the NLP part of the walkthrough can be downloaded 
[here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XrmkevxgSc-jtsBXszavKvPfrPTx2iv0/view?usp=sharing)

### Setup
Running the full notebook in the original architecture requires Python 3 with dependencies installed
and access to Elasticsearch >7.4 and [Redis](https://redis.io/): to get Elastic up and running locally and quickly, the [docker](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.4/docker.html) setup
is strongly recommended. 


### Status
This is a WIP repo for my latest blog post. Come back soon for the full version!
